|624|0/1 Knapsack|[printing 0/1 Knapsack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-items-01-knapsack/). I did't feel like cleaning the code but it just simple Knapsack, don't assume any condition or anything. This "45 8 44 43 12 9 8 2 4 10"shouldn't produce same answer as the example. and the example can be violated.|
